Contains all tests for the projects. To create a test file the file name must start with `test`, ex. `test_{obj}.py`. The class then should extend `unitTest.testCase`. The `setUp` function sets up the tests nad the remainder of the functions each execute a test.

NOTE: Where possible, tests should specify the functionality they are testing in comments within the functions.
